PaLM Chatbot is a Python application that uses the Google Generative AI (PaLM) API and Gradio to create a simple chat interface for generating text responses.

## Description

This chatbot allows users to interact by typing messages into a text box. The application then uses the PaLM API to generate text responses based on the user input. It leverages Gradio for creating an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Chat Interface:** Users can type messages to interact with the chatbot.
- **Text Generation:** Utilizes the PaLM API to generate responses based on user input.
- **User-Friendly:** Built with Gradio for a straightforward and interactive user experience.
